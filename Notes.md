# Skia WASM Library
- objective is to...
    - have a c++ library to link to, with minimal js/hmtl wrappings
    - hide as much as possible of the html/js gubbins from the client C++ code

## Next Steps
- rtti shenanigans
- integrate building skia into cmake
    - tidy up linking args
- figure out event loops so updates happen
- figure out how to handle resize events
- write a "how to"
- put a prebuilt version somewhere?
