# Skia WASM Library
A minimal library that allows a program written in C++ that uses the [skia](https://skia.org/) drawing library to execute in the browser and draw on a HTML canvas.

Very much a work in progress at the moment and not ready to be used.

## License

Some of this code is based on the `CanvasKit` JS library, which is part of the Skia project. As such it copies some google code, this is indicated in several files and references the LICENSE.GOOGLE file.
